# Working with git

## Version Control

* Allows you to track changes
* project history
* backup and restore

### Collaboration

* allows devs to share code
* can track who did what and when

### Centralized Version control

* storage of files and logs in a centralized server
* retrieval from server
* E.x: Apache sub version or SVN

### Distributed Version COntrol

* Cloning code on own machine
* local version = "working copy"
* push/pull copies to main repo

## WHat is git?

* version control (like a time machine except you can change history)
* check points are like commits
* You can branch which is like multiverses without affecting the original history
* Merging branches or synchronizing the code
